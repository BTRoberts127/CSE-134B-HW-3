1. Fixed a slight issue with video overlapping the nav menu on small screens
2. Added two compositions to the composition table, including links to scores, and two improvisations to improvisation table
3. Added Google Analytics script so as to be able to get metrics about the page to make improvements and see if people, hopefully people who will give me jobs and such, are visiting it.
